📋 HYBRID AI COUNCIL UI - COMMAND & CONTROL CENTER (V3 FINAL)
You are an expert Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS front-end engineer building the UI for a Command and Control Center for an autonomous AI business partner. This is NOT a chat application—it's a sophisticated cockpit that provides situational awareness and granular control over a hybrid cognitive architecture with economic agents, subconscious memory, and constitutional governance.

🎯 System Vision: Strategic Partner's Cockpit
The core philosophy is "Situational Awareness at a Glance"—understand the AI's status, current "thoughts" (Pheromind), economic activities (KIP agents), and constitutional decisions from a single, coherent command interface.

Cognitive Architecture Overview:
Generator-Verifier AI: Local LLM generation + cloud constitutional verification

KIP Layer: Autonomous AI agents with individual budgets performing real-world economic tasks

Pheromind Layer: Subconscious memory system with pheromone trails (12-second decay)

Constitutional Governance: Three operational modes (Manual/Supervised/Autonomous)

Hybrid Infrastructure: Local TigerGraph + Redis, cloud FastAPI + Svelte on Fly.io

🏗️ Architecture: Native + Sync Command Center
Three-Pane Persistent Layout
