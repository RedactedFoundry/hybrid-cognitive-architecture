# 🎯 Current Issues & Priorities

> **Last Updated**: August 6, 2025  @ 12:30am
> **Status**: Sprint 3 completed - preparing for Sprint 4 (Cloud Hybrid Deployment)

## ✅ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS (August 5-6, 2025)**

### **🎉 Comprehensive Codebase Cleanup COMPLETED**
- ✅ **Removed 13 redundant/temporary files** (startup scripts, debug tests, legacy files)
- ✅ **Moved 4 large docs to external storage** (47KB+ performance gain)
- ✅ **Reorganized 3 files** to proper directories (tests/, scripts/)
- ✅ **Updated PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** with complete cleanup documentation
- ✅ **Maintained all essential functionality** while improving performance

### **🚀 Voice System IMPLEMENTED (Needs Optimization)**
- ✅ **Python 3.13/3.11 microservice architecture** working
- ✅ **STT (NeMo Parakeet)** processing voice input correctly
- ✅ **TTS (Coqui XTTS v2)** generating audio output (primary voice only)
- ✅ **One-command startup** (`python start_all.py`) starts everything
- ✅ **Basic voice chat** functional but not optimal

**Voice System Limitations**:
- ❌ **No real-time streaming** - waits for complete answer before speaking
- ❌ **No "being typed" effect** - can't see output as it's generated
- ❌ **No mid-answer stopping** - can't interrupt responses
- ❌ **Single voice only** - multi-voice not yet implemented
- ❌ **Longer latency** - especially for complex council deliberations

### **🔧 System Architecture OPTIMIZED**
- ✅ **External storage integration** (symbolic links to `D:\Council-Project\`)
- ✅ **Performance optimization** (92% reduction in main repo size)
- ✅ **Clean file organization** (149 files, properly structured)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (all essential tests maintained)

## 🔒 **LOCKED ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

### **TTS Engine Choice (August 5, 2025)**
- **FINAL DECISION**: **Coqui XTTS v2** for ALL voice synthesis (no backup APIs for MVP)
- **Rationale**: Multi-voice council support, 200ms latency, local privacy, unlimited usage
- **Documentation**: `decisions/004-coqui-xtts-v2-for-council-voices.md`
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (basic functionality working, needs optimization)

### **Python Version Split (August 5, 2025)**
- **FINAL DECISION**: **Python 3.13 (main) + Python 3.11 (voice microservice)**
- **Rationale**: Resolves compatibility issues, maximizes performance
- **Documentation**: `decisions/005-python-313-311-microservice-architecture.md`
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

## ✅ **Critical Issues RESOLVED (August 4-6, 2025)**

- [x] **REST API Hanging**: Fixed rate limiting middleware Redis timeout issue
- [x] **System Verification**: All 5/5 components now PASS
- [x] **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Confirmed all 3 LLMs working together
- [x] **Security Middleware**: Full stack operational with timeout protection
- [x] **Voice System Integration**: Basic voice pipeline operational
- [x] **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed all redundant/temporary files
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Moved large docs to external storage
- [x] **File Organization**: Proper directory structure established

## 🔥 **Critical (Fix ASAP)**

- [ ] **Test Suite Verification**: Re-run tests with Docker services running
- [ ] **Voice System Optimization**: Implement real-time streaming and "being typed" effect
- [ ] **KIP System Refinement**: Make economic system real-world ready

## ⚡ **High Priority (This Sprint - Sprint 4)**

### **Cloud Migration Preparation**
- [ ] **Render Deployment Configuration**: Set up cloud services
- [ ] **Tailscale Network Setup**: Secure local-cloud communication
- [ ] **Service Migration Strategy**: Move non-GPU services to cloud
- [ ] **Hybrid Architecture Testing**: Verify local-cloud integration

### **Voice System Enhancement**
- [ ] **Real-time Streaming**: Implement token-by-token voice output
- [ ] **"Being Typed" Effect**: Show text generation in real-time
- [ ] **Mid-answer Stopping**: Allow interruption of responses
- [ ] **Multi-voice Implementation**: Enable different council member voices

### **KIP Economic System Refinement**
- [ ] **Real-world Budget Management**: Enhance agent budget controls
- [ ] **Transaction Validation**: Improve economic decision validation
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Add KPI tracking for agents
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Implement economic risk controls

## 📋 **Medium Priority (Next Sprint)**

### **Development Experience**  
- [ ] **Common Patterns Documentation**: Standard coding conventions
- [ ] **Integration Flow Map**: How components interact  
- [ ] **Debugging Runbook**: Project-specific troubleshooting
- [ ] **Development Templates**: New endpoint/agent/test templates

### **Operational Excellence**
- [ ] **Feature Flags System**: Runtime configuration toggles
- [ ] **Error Code Dictionary**: Structured error handling
- [ ] **One-Command Operations**: Makefile for dev-setup, test-all, etc.
- [ ] **Health Check Utilities**: Runtime service monitoring

## 💡 **Ideas/Future (Someday Maybe)**

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agents working together on complex tasks
- [ ] **Learning from Performance**: Agents adapting strategies based on ROI
- [ ] **External Data Integration**: Real-time market data feeds
- [ ] **Mobile Monitoring App**: Check agent performance on phone

### **Scaling Considerations**
- [ ] **Multi-Currency Support**: Trading in different currencies
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: SEC/financial regulation adherence
- [ ] **Professional Services**: KIP-as-a-Service for other businesses
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace**: Buy/sell high-performing agent genomes

## 🎯 **Current Focus Decision Points**

### **Immediate Choice Required:**
**Question**: Should we optimize voice system first, or proceed with Sprint 4 cloud migration?  
**Recommendation**: Proceed with Sprint 4 - voice optimization can be done in parallel

### **This Week's Goal:**
**Target**: Complete Sprint 4 preparation and begin cloud migration

### **Sprint 4 Priority Order:**
1. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup** (Render, Tailscale)
2. **Service Migration** (non-GPU services to cloud)
3. **Hybrid Testing** (local-cloud integration)
4. **Voice Optimization** (real-time streaming)
