> **Status**: PRODUCTION READY - MCP Integration COMPLETED - Sprint 4 Ready

## ✅ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

### **🎉 MCP Server Integration & Baseline Optimization COMPLETED (August 11, 2025)**
- ✅ **Baseline Performance**: 9.8/10 quality, 94.4% routing accuracy, 0% template pollution (vs 5.3/10, 55.6%, 38.9% initial)
- ✅ **MCP Server Integration**: Pieces LTM + Jinni context servers connected with debugging loop prevention
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Critical fix - TigerGraph/Redis data now persists across restarts (Docker volumes)
- ✅ **Cloud-Ready Refactor**: All hardcoded paths → environment variables, Sprint 4 deployment ready
- ✅ **VRAM Optimization**: 94.6% → 65.3% usage (freed 7GB), virtual memory pressure resolved
- ✅ **Auto-Startup**: Docker + llama.cpp startup/health with Windows-safe UTF-8 logs
- ✅ **TigerGraph Database**: Working schema with sample data, GraphStudio accessible, reserved word fixes
- ✅ **JSON Prompting**: Domain-agnostic analytical framework with Perplexity v1.3 improvements

### **🎉 Constitution v5.4 Architecture COMPLETED (August 10, 2025)**
- ✅ **HuiHui GPT-OSS 20B + Mistral 7B architecture** fully operational
- ✅ **llama.cpp integration** working as unified backend (generator + verifier)
- ✅ **ModelRouter** routes exclusively to llama.cpp (Ollama removed)
- ✅ **Simple Generator-Verifier flow** replaces legacy multi-agent complexity
- ✅ **GPT-5 backup system** implemented (with Mistral substitute)
- ✅ **User override commands** working ("proceed anyway", "explain more", etc.)
- ✅ **Safety floors enforced** (legal ≥0.85, financial ≥0.75)
- ✅ **Streaming & Direct orchestrator** both use Constitution v5.4 flow

### **🔧 CRITICAL VRAM OPTIMIZATION RESOLVED (August 10, 2025)**
- ✅ **Ollama removed**: Registry/VRAM issues eliminated by unifying on llama.cpp
- ✅ **Mistral VRAM usage**: Reduced from 9.2GB → 6.6GB (28% improvement)
- ✅ **Total VRAM pressure**: From 95.5% → 86.6% utilization  
- ✅ **Model timeout issues**: Completely resolved
- ✅ **VRAM baseline**: Only 2.9GB when no models loaded (excellent)

### **🎉 Comprehensive Codebase Cleanup COMPLETED (August 5-6, 2025)**
- ✅ **Removed 13 redundant/temporary files** (startup scripts, debug tests, legacy files)
- ✅ **Moved 4 large docs to external storage** (47KB+ performance gain)
- ✅ **Reorganized 3 files** to proper directories (tests/, scripts/)
- ✅ **Updated PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** with complete cleanup documentation
- ✅ **Maintained all essential functionality** while improving performance

### **🚀 Voice System IMPLEMENTED (Needs Optimization)**
- ✅ **Python 3.13/3.11 microservice architecture** working
- ✅ **STT (NeMo Parakeet)** processing voice input correctly
- ✅ **TTS (Coqui XTTS v2)** generating audio output (primary voice only)
- ✅ **One-command startup** (`python start_all.py`) starts everything
- ✅ **Basic voice chat** functional but not optimal

**Voice System Limitations**:
- ❌ **No real-time streaming** - waits for complete answer before speaking
- ❌ **No "being typed" effect** - can't see output as it's generated
- ❌ **No mid-answer stopping** - can't interrupt responses
- ❌ **Single voice only** - multi-voice not yet implemented
- ❌ **Longer latency** - especially for complex council deliberations

### **🔧 System Architecture OPTIMIZED**
- ✅ **External storage integration** (symbolic links to `D:\Council-Project\`)
- ✅ **Performance optimization** (92% reduction in main repo size)
- ✅ **Clean file organization** (149 files, properly structured)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (all essential tests maintained)

## 🔒 **LOCKED ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

### **TTS Engine Choice (August 5, 2025)**
- **FINAL DECISION**: **Coqui XTTS v2** for ALL voice synthesis (no backup APIs for MVP)
- **Rationale**: Multi-voice council support, 200ms latency, local privacy, unlimited usage
- **Documentation**: `decisions/004-coqui-xtts-v2-for-council-voices.md`
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (basic functionality working, needs optimization)

### **Python Version Split (August 5, 2025)**
- **FINAL DECISION**: **Python 3.13 (main) + Python 3.11 (voice microservice)**
- **Rationale**: Resolves compatibility issues, maximizes performance
- **Documentation**: `decisions/005-python-313-311-microservice-architecture.md`
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

## 🧠 **FUTURE IDEAS (Not Current Priorities)**

### **System Self-Awareness Module**
- Give orchestrator curated knowledge of its own architecture and capabilities
- Could explain its 3-layer system (Pheromind/Council/KIP) to users
- Could suggest optimizations and identify issues
- Could improve routing decisions based on system state
- **Scope**: High-level architecture knowledge, NOT full codebase access
- **Benefits**: Better user explanations, self-improvement, development partnership
- **Risks**: Information overload, security concerns
- **Status**: Shelved for post-Sprint 4 consideration

**The Constitution v5.4 architecture is complete and production-ready! Unified llama.cpp backend removes Ollama registry issues. Voice TTS is CPU-only (expected slower), streaming to be added. 🚀**
