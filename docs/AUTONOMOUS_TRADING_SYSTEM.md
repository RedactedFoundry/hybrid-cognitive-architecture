‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 15+ years historical data (stocks, crypto, forex, commodities)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Paper trading with real market conditions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multi-timeframe strategy testing (scalping to swing trading)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk scenario simulations (crashes, volatility spikes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent vs Agent trading competitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Strategy evolution and genetic algorithms
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Performance benchmarking against market indices
```

### **No External Dependencies**
- **No clients to manage** - agents trade their own capital
- **No customer service** - pure algorithmic operations
- **No sales process** - performance speaks for itself
- **No delivery obligations** - profits are immediate and measurable
- **No human coordination** - agents operate 24/7 independently
