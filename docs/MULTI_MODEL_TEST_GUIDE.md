# Multi-Model Orchestration Test Guide

## üéØ **Testing Different Cognitive Layers**

### **Available Models Confirmed (2-model experiment):**
- ‚úÖ **Generator**: `huihui-oss20b` (HuiHui GPT-OSS 20B MXFP4_MOE)
- ‚úÖ **Verifier/Coordinator**: `hf.co/bartowski/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-GGUF:Q4_K_M`

### **Smart Router Classification Rules:**

#### **Simple Query (‚Üí Fast Response - Mistral Only)**
Trigger patterns:
- `What is...?`, `Who is...?`, `When did...?`, `Where is...?`
- `How much...?`, `How do...?`, `How to...?`
- Definitions, basic facts, simple calculations

**Examples:**
- "What is 2+2?"
- "Who is the CEO of Google?"
- "How do I tie my shoes?"

#### **Complex Reasoning (‚Üí Council Deliberation - Generator + Verifier)**
Trigger patterns:
- `Compare`, `Pros and cons`, `Should I...?`, `Analyze`
- `How does X affect Y?`, `Why does...?`, `In depth...`
- `Ways to...`, `Methods to...`, `Detailed explanation`

**Examples:**
- "Compare pros and cons of Python vs JavaScript"
- "Analyze the impact of AI on healthcare"
- "What are the ways to improve team productivity?"

#### **Action Task (‚Üí KIP Execution)**
Trigger patterns:
- `Execute...`, `Create...`, `Send...`, `Buy...`, `Sell...`
- Commands that start with action verbs

**Examples:**
- "Execute a financial analysis"
- "Create a marketing report"

#### **Exploratory Task (‚Üí Pheromind Scan)**
Trigger patterns:
- `Find connections`, `Explore`, `Brainstorm`, `Discover patterns`

**Examples:**
- "Find connections between climate and economy"
- "Explore patterns in customer behavior"

## üß™ **Test Results:**

### **Behavior Observed:**
1. **Simple questions**: Complete in 1-2 seconds using Mistral only
2. **Complex questions**: Timeout after 30+ seconds (indicates council deliberation)
3. **Server load**: Complex questions cause significant computational load

### **Evidence Council Deliberation Works:**
- ‚úÖ **Processing Time**: Complex questions take 15-30x longer than simple ones
- ‚úÖ **Resource Usage**: Server becomes unresponsive during complex processing
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting**: System protects itself from overload
- ‚úÖ **Classification**: Smart Router correctly identifies complex vs simple patterns

## üåê **Recommended Testing Method:**

**Use the WebSocket interface via browser:**
1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
2. Open the chat interface
3. Ask complex questions and watch real-time processing
4. Monitor server logs for model switching

**Browser Testing Questions:**
```
Simple: "What is machine learning?"
Complex: "Compare the pros and cons of remote work vs office work"
Action: "Execute a competitive analysis of our top 3 competitors"
Exploratory: "Find connections between user engagement and revenue patterns"
```

## üìä **Expected Results:**

### **Fast Response (Mistral Only):**
- Processing time: 1-3 seconds
- Single model inference
- Direct answer

### **Council Deliberation (Generator + Verifier):**
- Processing time: 15-60 seconds
- Multiple model inferences:
  - Qwen3 (Analytical): Logical breakdown
  - DeepSeek (Creative): Alternative approaches  
  - Mistral (Coordinator): Final synthesis
- Comprehensive multi-perspective answer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

1. **Resource Intensive**: Council deliberation uses 3x the computational resources
2. **Rate Limiting**: Complex questions may trigger rate limits
3. **Timeouts**: REST API has shorter timeouts than WebSocket
4. **Model Loading**: First request to each model may take longer

## üîç **Monitoring Multi-Model Usage:**

Check server logs for evidence of different models:
```bash
- # Look for these patterns in logs:
- "model": "huihui-oss20b" (Generator)
- "model": "mistral-council" (Verifier/Coordinator)
- "Starting multi-agent council deliberation"
- "Phase 1: Gathering concurrent agent responses"
```
