# **Hybrid AI Council: Architectural Blueprint v3.8 (Final)**

This document represents the complete and final architectural plan for the **\[System Name\]**, an autonomous AI system designed for advanced, continuous business operations. It incorporates all strategic decisions, component selections, and operational safeguards. This is the implementation-ready blueprint.

## **Core Architectural Principles**

* **Human-AI Interaction Model ("Strategic Partner"):** The AI operates with a high degree of autonomy within defined boundaries. The human user sets the high-level strategy, goals, and ethical constitution, while the AI manages tactical execution.  
* **Three-Layered Cognitive Architecture:** The AI's internal system, the **Hybrid Council**, is structured like a brain with a subconscious (Pheromind), a conscious decision-making body (Council), and a goal-driven action engine (KIP).  
* **Hybrid Deployment Model:** Core business logic and data persistence layers are deployed to a reliable cloud host (Render) for 24/7 accessibility, while specialized GPU inference remains on a local machine for cost-efficiency and privacy.  
* **Autonomous Economic Engine:** Business functions are driven by autonomous agents that operate on real budgets and are optimized against key performance indicators (KPIs), creating a self-improving economic system.  
* **Continuous Learning via Memory Consolidation:** The AI bridges short-term, ephemeral insights with a permanent, structured knowledge graph, ensuring it grows wiser and does not suffer from amnesia.  
* **Governance and Safety by Design:** The system is built with an un-editable "conscience" and robust safety mechanisms to ensure all autonomous actions are aligned, secure, and controllable.  
* **Real-time Streaming Interface:** The system is built on a streaming-first architecture (WebSockets) to provide a responsive, conversational user experience and to serve as the foundation for voice I/O.

## **System Layers & Components**

### **Layer 1: The Core Compute & Data Engine (The "Machine Room")**

| Component | Technology Selection | Deployment Location | Primary Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Local LLM Ensemble** | Qwen3-14B-AWQ, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct-FP8, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3-AWQ | **Local Rig (RTX 4090\)** | The core trio of specialized models for reasoning, complex task execution, and speed. |
| **LLM Runtime** | Ollama | **Local Rig (RTX 4090\)** | Provides high-throughput, low-latency inference for the local LLM ensemble. |
| **Voice Processing Microservice** | Python 3.11 + NeMo Parakeet + Coqui XTTS v2 | **Local Rig (RTX 4090\)** | SOTA speech recognition and multi-voice synthesis with ~200ms latency. |
| **Hybrid Database** | TigerVector (in Docker) | **Cloud (Render)** | The permanent long-term memory store, combining graph relationships and vector search. |
| **User & AI Persona Model** | Dedicated Graph Schema | **Cloud (Render)** | A dynamic model of the user's goals AND the AI's own personality/tone for deep alignment. |
| **Multi-hop Memory** | HippoRAG 2 | **Cloud (Render)** | An overlay service for the Hybrid DB that enables complex, multi-step queries. |
| **Working Memory** | Managed Redis | **Cloud (Render)** | High-speed, in-memory store serving as the Pheromone Environment (12s TTL). |
| **Cloud Fallback** | Gemini 2.5 Pro | **Cloud (Google Cloud)** | A powerful, scalable cloud model to handle overflow tasks or if the local rig is offline. |

### **Layer 2: The Cognitive & Agentic Architecture (The "Hybrid Council")**

This is the internal "mind" of the AI, where information is processed, decisions are made, and autonomous actions are initiated. It is not directly user-facing.

#### **2a. The Pheromind Cognitive Layer (The Subconscious)**

* **Role:** An always-on, ambient intelligence layer that processes all incoming data streams in real time to find non-obvious connections and provide proactive awareness.  
* **Key Components:** Ambient Swarm, Memory Scent Mechanism.

#### **2b. The Council (The Conscious Decision-Making Body)**

* **Role:** The central decision-making body that debates options, weighs evidence, and provides final recommendations to the orchestrator.  
* **Key Components:** GEDI Decision Module, Explainability (XAI) Engine.

#### **2c. The KIP Economic Layer (The Action Engine)**

* **Role:** The goal-driven business operations engine that executes real-world tasks autonomously.  
* **Key Components:** Autonomous KIP Agents, Treasury & Cost Management Engine, KPI-based Fitness Function.

### **Layer 3: The Governance & Interface Stack (The "Control Panel & Senses")**

This crucial layer connects the internal Hybrid Council to the real world, ensuring all interactions are safe, observable, and effective.

| Component | Technology Selection | Primary Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User-Facing Orchestrator** | **LangGraph Orchestrator** | The **single point of contact** for the user. It receives prompts, coordinates the internal Hybrid Council, synthesizes the final response, and communicates using its own defined personality. |
| **Voice Integration Layer** | **Python 3.13/3.11 Microservice Architecture** | Seamless integration between main system (Python 3.13) and voice processing (Python 3.11) via HTTP API. |
| **Governance & Safety** | Constitutional Guardrail, Circuit Breaker, **Operational Mode Switch** | A non-evolving ruleset that enforces ethical/operational boundaries, can instantly halt all actions, and allows the user to adjust the AI's autonomy level (Manual, Supervised, Autonomous). |
| **Secure Overlay Network** | Tailscale | Creates a secure, private network connecting the cloud services (Render) to the local GPU rig. |
| **Secure Action** | Tool Abstraction & Sandbox Layer (gVisor) | Standardizes and secures all external API calls, allowing for the safe testing of agent actions. |
| **Tool & Skill Library** | Version-Controlled Registry | A central library for storing, managing, and sharing versioned "tools" and "skills". **For the MVP, this will be implemented as a structured directory within the project's Git repository.** |
| **Memory Consolidation** | Custom Consolidation Agent | The bridge between working memory (Redis) and long-term memory (TigerVector). **This agent will be implemented as a scheduled task (e.g., a cron job) that runs on a daily cycle.** |
| **Observability** | Prometheus, Grafana, Langfuse Suite | A holistic suite for monitoring the AI's health, performance, and behavior. |
| **Red Team Environment** | Isolated Simulation Sandbox | A full clone of the architecture for adversarial testing of agents before production deployment. |
| **User Interface (UI)** | FastAPI (with WebSockets) \+ React/Streamlit | The human-computer interface, built on a streaming-first foundation with voice chat capabilities. |
