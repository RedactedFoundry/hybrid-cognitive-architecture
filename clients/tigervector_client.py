This client connects to TigerGraph Community Edition running in Docker.
Community Edition uses default credentials and runs on localhost:14240.

Setup Requirements:
1. Run ./scripts/setup-tigergraph.sh (Linux/Mac) or ./scripts/setup-tigergraph.ps1 (Windows)
2. Ensure TigerGraph container is running: docker ps | grep tigergraph
3. Verify GraphStudio access: http://localhost:14240

Default Configuration:
- Host: http://localhost:14240
- Username: tigergraph  
- Password: tigergraph
- Graph: HybridAICouncil
