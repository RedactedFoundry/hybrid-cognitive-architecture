# Decision Record: Python 3.13/3.11 Microservice Architecture for Voice System

## Status
**ACCEPTED** - Implemented and operational

## Context
The Hybrid AI Council project was running on Python 3.13, but voice processing libraries (NeMo Parakeet for STT and Coqui XTTS v2 for TTS) require Python <3.12 due to dependency conflicts with PyTorch, Transformers, and other ML libraries.

## Problem
- Voice chat was completely broken with voice foundation returning `None`
- No audio output from TTS
- STT not understanding speech
- Direct voice library imports causing dependency conflicts in main project
- Python 3.13 incompatibility with voice/ML libraries

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Downgrade Entire Project to Python 3.11
**Pros:**
- Single Python version for all components
- Direct voice library imports possible
- Simpler deployment and dependency management

**Cons:**
- Lose Python 3.13 benefits (GIL improvements, JIT compilation, performance enhancements)
- Main project would not benefit from latest Python features
- All components would be constrained by voice library requirements

### Option 2: Python 3.13/3.11 Microservice Architecture
**Pros:**
- Main project keeps Python 3.13 benefits for core AI system
- Voice processing isolated in dedicated microservice
- Clean separation of concerns
- Scalable architecture for future ML components
- HTTP API communication provides loose coupling

**Cons:**
- More complex deployment (two Python environments)
- Additional network communication overhead
- Need to manage two sets of dependencies

### Option 3: Cloud-Based Voice Service
**Pros:**
- No local Python version conflicts
- Scalable voice processing
- Can use any Python version in cloud

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connectivity
- Additional latency for voice processing
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Privacy concerns for voice data

## Decision
**Selected Option 2: Python 3.13/3.11 Microservice Architecture**

## Rationale
1. **Performance Benefits**: Main project retains Python 3.13 GIL improvements and JIT compilation benefits for core AI operations
2. **Scalability**: Microservice architecture allows future ML components to be isolated
3. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between core AI system and voice processing
4. **Local Processing**: Voice processing remains local for privacy and low latency
5. **Future-Proof**: Architecture supports adding more Python 3.11-only ML services

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
```
Main Project (Python 3.13)
├── Core AI System (Orchestrator, KIP, Pheromind)
├── Web Interface (FastAPI + WebSockets)
└── Voice Client (HTTP client for voice service)

Voice Microservice (Python 3.11)
├── FastAPI Service
├── NeMo Parakeet STT Engine
└── Coqui XTTS v2 TTS Engine
```

### Communication
- **Protocol**: HTTP API between services
- **Voice Service**: Runs on port 8011
- **Main API**: Runs on port 8001
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive service monitoring

### Deployment
- **One-Command Startup**: `python start_all.py` starts all services
- **Docker Integration**: TigerGraph and Redis via Docker
- **Local Services**: Voice service and main API as local processes

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Voice system fully operational with SOTA engines
- ✅ Main project retains Python 3.13 performance benefits
- ✅ Clean microservice architecture for future ML components
- ✅ One-command startup for all services
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and health monitoring

### Challenges
- **Complexity**: Two Python environments to manage
- **Dependencies**: Need to maintain separate dependency files
- **Testing**: More complex testing across service boundaries

## Technical Implementation

### Voice Service (Python 3.11)
```python
# python311-services/voice/main.py
@app.post("/voice/stt")
@app.post("/voice/tts")
@app.get("/health")

# python311-services/voice/engines/voice_engines.py
class STTEngine:  # NeMo Parakeet
class TTSEngine:  # Coqui XTTS v2
```

### Main Project Integration
```python
# voice_foundation/voice_client.py
class VoiceServiceClient:
    def transcribe_audio(self, audio_file: Path) -> str
    def synthesize_speech(self, text: str, voice_id: str) -> Path
    def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Startup Script
```python
# start_all.py
def start_services():
    # 1. Start Docker containers (TigerGraph, Redis)
    # 2. Verify Ollama models
    # 3. Initialize database
    # 4. Start voice service (Python 3.11)
    # 5. Start main API (Python 3.13)
    # 6. Verify all services
```

## Performance Metrics
- **STT Latency**: ~500ms (NeMo Parakeet)
- **TTS Latency**: ~200ms (Coqui XTTS v2)
- **Service Communication**: HTTP API with timeout protection
- **Startup Time**: ~60 seconds for all services
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime with health checks

## Status
**COMPLETED** - Voice system fully operational and committed to git
