```python
class MarketingROI(BaseModel):
    cost_per_lead: float           # $5-25 typical
    lead_value: float              # $50-500 client pays
    conversion_rate: float         # 2-8% typical
    campaign_roi: float            # 200-800% target
    client_satisfaction: float     # 1-5 rating
    repeat_business: bool          # Recurring revenue indicator

### **Tool Cost Structure**
```
Basic Tools (High Volume):
├── Email validation: $0.10 per email
├── Social media posting: $0.25 per post
├── Engagement automation: $0.25 per interaction
└── Content generation: $1.50 per piece

- **Campaign management**: $500-2000/month recurring
- **Performance bonus**: 10-20% of client revenue increase

### **Agent Economics**
```
Example: Lead Generation Agent

├── Generate: 20 qualified leads @ $150 each = $3,000 client value
├── Agent revenue share: 30% = $900 
├── Agent ROI: 900% ($900 earned / $100 spent)
└── Client ROI: 300% ($3,000 value / $1,000 paid to service)
```
