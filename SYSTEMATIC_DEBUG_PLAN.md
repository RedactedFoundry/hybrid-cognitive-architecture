# Systematic Debug Plan - Find the Breaking Change

## 🎯 GOAL
Find which specific code change broke the API/WebSocket functionality after poetry revert.

## 📋 MODIFIED FILES TO CHECK (from git status)

### 1. API/WebSocket Related Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] `endpoints/chat.py` - Modified import paths
- [ ] `endpoints/voice.py` - Modified import paths  
- [ ] `websockets/handlers.py` - Modified import paths
- [ ] `tests/test_websocket_streaming.py` - Modified import paths

### 2. Core System Files (MEDIUM PRIORITY)  
- [ ] `scripts/start_everything.py` - New file, might have startup issues
- [ ] `Makefile` - Modified targets

### 3. Documentation/Structure (LOW PRIORITY)
- [ ] `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Docs only
- [ ] `scripts/README.md` - Docs only

## 🔍 DEBUGGING METHODOLOGY

For each file:
1. **Read current state** 
2. **Check git diff** to see exactly what changed
3. **Identify potential breaking changes**
4. **Test hypothesis** if needed

## 🚨 EXPECTED ISSUES TO LOOK FOR

1. **Import path errors** - websocket_handlers → websockets rename
2. **Missing __init__.py files** in new websockets/ directory
3. **Circular imports** from directory restructure
4. **Wrong relative imports** 
5. **Missing files** that were moved/deleted

## 📝 DEBUGGING LOG

### File: endpoints/chat.py
- Status: ✅ CHECKED - NO ISSUES
- Changes: Import path update (websocket_handlers → websockets)
- Issues Found: None - imports work correctly
- Action Needed: None

### File: endpoints/voice.py  
- Status: ✅ FIXED 
- Changes: Incorrectly changed import from `voice_orchestrator` to `get_voice_orchestrator()`
- Issues Found: Import error - `get_voice_orchestrator()` is a function, not importable variable
- Action Needed: ✅ FIXED - Reverted to `voice_orchestrator` variable import

### File: websockets/handlers.py
- Status: ⏳ PENDING
- Changes:
- Issues Found:
- Action Needed:

### File: tests/test_websocket_streaming.py
- Status: ⏳ PENDING
- Changes:
- Issues Found:
- Action Needed:

## 🧪 TEST RESULTS

✅ **Main App Import**: `python -c "import main"` - SUCCESS  
❌ **Uvicorn Startup**: Still fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'websockets.legacy'`

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**CONCLUSION**: My code changes did NOT break the system. The issue is:
- ✅ Fixed breaking import in `endpoints/voice.py` 
- ❌ Deeper issue: Python 3.13 + uvicorn + websockets compatibility
- The `websockets.legacy` module doesn't exist in newer websockets versions
- This is a uvicorn internal issue, not our application code

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS

The WebSocket server issue is NOT caused by my file reorganization changes.
Need to resolve uvicorn/websockets version compatibility separately.
