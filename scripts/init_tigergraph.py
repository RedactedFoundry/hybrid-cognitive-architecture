TigerGraph Community Edition Initialization Script

Automatically creates the HybridAICouncil database and loads the schema.
Designed for TigerGraph Community Edition running in Docker.

Prerequisites:
1. TigerGraph Community Edition container running (use setup-tigergraph.sh)
2. Schema file available at schemas/schema.gsql
3. pyTigerGraph installed (pip install pyTigerGraph)

Usage:
    python scripts/init_tigergraph.py
